# Clusters of Things 
In this project, a model is created for generating simulations associated to groups and groups inside groups using pointers to generate a datafield and assign specific rules defined as functions and properties to the points in the datafields. An element 'e' containing sub elements 'e_1, e_2, and e_3', for example, would adapt the following data structure in this model:
